metadata:
    description: >
        RavelCast allows to share text messages of any content, completely anonymous, without registration and any clues
        about users identity. Preliminary messages encryption and deletion upon receiving guarantees that your information
        will be accessible only to those who intended to see it. And nobody else.

        %paragraph_open%My identity is irrelevant. My name is unimportant. Only information I produce has

        %paragraph_open%Information is our property. The product of our existence. Our most valuable possession. Our past

        %paragraph_open%I want to be the only one who owns my information. The one who possess my thoughts. Who knows what

    intention:
        title: Intention
        text: >
            %paragraph_open%RavelCast is a utility to allow anonymous sending and receiving of encrypted text messages,
            which is fully respects privacy of your personal data.%paragraph_close%
            %paragraph_open%Information that you do not want or afraid to send over the Internet can be transmitted
            through RavelCast. Without registration and with no strings attached.%paragraph_close%
            %paragraph_open%The main thing is that your identity in RavelCast cannot be identified by your messages.
            It’s just information that is not bound to a specific user.%paragraph_close%

    implementation:
        title: Implementation
        text: >
            %paragraph_open%The ultimate concept of RavelCast is the absence of chains of demands and requirements, which
            shackles user during exchange of information or casts doubt about its safety.%paragraph_close%
            %paragraph_open%With this thought we’ve raised four pillars which would allow confidential and easy exchange
            of relatively short (about 4200 symbols) secret messages.%paragraph_close%
        feature:
            anonymity:
                title: Completely anonymous
                text: >
                    %paragraph_open%No registration. No authorization. RavelCast doesn’t require your name, email, phone
                    number or social network account. Nothing at all. All messages stored without any clues about identity
                    of sender or recipient.%paragraph_close%
            crypting:
                title: Data encryption
                text: >
                    %paragraph_open%Message is encrypted on the client side before sending and additionally on the server
                    side. Your original message and password doesn’t even leave your browser and are not transferred over
                    the Web, excluding probability of being read by man-in-the-middle or server holders.%paragraph_close%
            sweeping:
                title: Covering your tracks
                text: >
                    %paragraph_open%Messages are one-off and removed upon receiving. Even before you get the message,
                    RavelCast will forever forget about its existence. In addition, each message has an adjustable lifetime,
                    and will be deleted at the end of it – even if that message remains unread.%paragraph_close%
            defense:
                title: Comprehensive protection
                text: >
                    %paragraph_open%TLS (Transport Layer Security) is used to establish secured connection during messages
                    exchange. Data is encrypted with most reliable of the existing cryptographic algorithms and hash
                    functions. RavelCast itself is designed based on well-tested and stable software platform.%paragraph_close%

                %paragraph_open%Create Password and tell it to the person with whom you want to exchange secret messages.
                Or you can use RavelCast as temporary storage for your private information – in this case, keep the
                password only to yourself.%paragraph_close%

            title: Transfer [Landmark]
            text: >
                %paragraph_open%This is a partial message identifier that can be freely transmitted through social networks,
                instant messengers, email or SMS to the person who should receive your message. The [Landmark] itself is
                useless without your Password: it won’t allow anyone to receive your message - or even learn about its
                existence.%paragraph_close%

                left. Enter your message and Password in it, and press “Encrypt”. Additionally, you can specify the lifetime
                of the message, which is 42 hours by default (maximum lifetime is 42 days). After sending you will receive
                a [Landmark].%paragraph_close%

recommendations:
    title: Recommendations
    item:
        1: >
            Come up with strong enough Password. Change it when communicating with different people, and also change it
            from time to time (remember Hogwarts?). The Password itself could be either a single word, or sequence of
            symbols, or even a complete sentence.
        2: >
            The best and most secure way to share your Password with somebody is to tell it in person.
        3: >
            For maximum security try to write message in a way that only you and your contact will understand.
        4: >
            Try to make sure that your computer (device) is not observed through software like Radmin, does not contain
            keyloggers and is not infected with viruses.
        5: >
            In order to ensure general anonymity in the Web, and particularly when working with RavelCast, use TOR Browser
            or similar software which masks your network address and browser’s fingerprint.

        Unforeseen circumstances have arrived during the message encryption
    unravel: >
        There is no such message. It could be that it's already read. Or its lifetime has ended.
        Or perhaps it never existed

        System's processing sequence was broken. Interesting, how did that happen?
